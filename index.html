        		<h1> Lifetime - your social diary </h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p> Let your friends know where you go, and never miss a friend next to you !</p>
			<p> More than just a location, Lifetime lets you indicate the real places you are going to, and integrate them in your day-to-day social interactions.
				<br> Want to know if one of your friends is nearby and up for a drink ?
				<br> When is the last time you've been to that awesome electro club and who was with you ?
				<br> Or simply who wishes to go to that super cool Italian restaurant that opened last week ?
				<br>
				<br> Lifetime ticks all the boxes and come along with a simple chat interface that lets you mix all these pieces of information with your daily conversations.
			</p>
			<p> How does it work ?
				<br> When you want to tell your friends where you are, simply tap on the central view, and let Lifetime shows you the places around you. Once you've found the one you are into, simply switch on the Check-in button and all your friends will see right away your location !
			</p>
			<p> Now you might wonder if Lifetime is going to track you 24/7 ?
				<br> Definitely not.
				<br> Because we like saving people's battery, and most of all, because we like privacy, we only refresh your location when the app is open, and most importantly, we only communicate it when you decide to check-in - so yes, you are the one in control here. 
			</p>
			<p> How should I start ?
				<br> Pretty simple, add your friends in the app, so you got your tribe with you, and start checking in the places you visit ! 
				<br> Going the extra mile ? Start browsing your friendsâ€™ activities and the places they wish to go to. Dive into their favorite places, and explore the latest recommendations around you.
			</p>
			<p> Want more ?
				<br> Places can be freely created in Lifetime. If the place you are into does not already exist, just create it right away !
				<br> But don't worry, Lifetime is on the watch - we will clean and keep the places around you tidy. We merge, delete, amend all created places to make sure the database reflects the current state of the world...  not less.
				<br> And of course, you can create anytime your own private places that only your friends can see.
			</p>
			<p> Oh and don't be surprised if all your friends start wooing you for a drink on Friday night... that's part of your Lifetime now.

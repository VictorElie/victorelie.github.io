			<br> Location. Lifetime is a location­based service and in order for the app to fully function we need permission to collect your precise location when you use the app. We only use your location to provide you with localized recommendations and when you attempt to check-in a nearby place.

			<br> Places. You can create public and private places in the app at anytime. The creation process is localization-based which means you can only create a place at your current location. A private place is accessible only by your friends, whereas a public place (any category other than ‘private’) is accessible by anyone. Lifetime may decide to delete or alter your created place at anytime, thus enabling a smooth evolution of the app database and deleting any inappropriate content.</br>
